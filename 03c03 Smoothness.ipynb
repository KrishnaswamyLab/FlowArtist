    "We want our vector field to be as simple as possible. One means of achieving this is to regularize it by smoothness, to penalize it for changing the direction of the vectors too suddenly. Here, I'll code up a grid-based laplacian normalizer. It will take samples from a grid graph in the support of the points and flow, calculate the  laplacian of the grid, and compute the smoothness via\n",
