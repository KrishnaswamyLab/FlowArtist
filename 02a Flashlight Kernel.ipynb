    "FRED at its core is a diffusion-based model; It embeds directed graphs and high dimensional data into euclidean space with a vector field in terms of probabilities, rather than distances.

    "\n",
    "The essence of the Flashlight Kernel is to retain asymmetric relationships between data points with directionality similar to that of directed graph nodes. It assigns affinities between two data points by considering both the distance between them and their associated vectors; Going with the flow is highly encouraged and going against or even perpendicular to the flow is discouraged and assigned affinity close to zero. As a result, diffusion or random walks probabilities from data point to data point is heavily dictated by the flow in the embedding space or vectors associated with data points in embient space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that affinities between data points can be (and almost always are) asymmetric i.e., $k(x_i, x_j) \\neq k(x_j, x_i)$ as the flow at $x_i$ may be pointing towards $x_j$, but the opposite may not be true. In fact, in single-cell data, this is rarely true as cells do not transition back and forth between two different states.\n",
