<p>The flow neighbor loss is quite simple -- it just gets the flow to point towards those points it points towards in the ambient space. But what about pointing <em>away</em> from other points? Here is an opportunity for innovation. We should penalize the network both for pointing away from points it should be pointing towards, <em>and for pointing towards points it should be pointing away from</em>.</p>
<p>The secret weapon here is already well established: the flashlight kernel, which blends distance and flow information to create a flow-based affinity. Taking these together, we want the affinities in ambient space to match those in the embedding space.</p>
