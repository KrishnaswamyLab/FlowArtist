<p>FlowNet is, at heart, an embedder of directed graphs. But what types of graphs? This notebook, and those nested under 01a01, contain a battery of toy directed graphs, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Directed) Stochastic Block Models</li>
<li>Trees</li>
</ol>
<p>This notebook houses a sampling of these graphs, with details on how to call them and visualize them.</p>
